<img src="pianophone black.png" class="center">
<p>Squaritone Pianophone is an experimental prog rock holiday-themed band that features two baritone saxophones and a piano. They make music or something.</p>

<h2>Meet the Members!</h2>
<div>
<h3>Reb Mendoza</h3>
<blockquote>
“The piano is not a table. It is <i>my</i> table.”
</blockquote>
<p>
 Mastermind behind the keys, Reb Mendoza is the composer of the band`s hit debut single “Duck Song,” and continued the proof of his mastery with “Duck Song II,” the title track on the new platinum-selling album. He enjoys long walks on the beach, poker, and making timelapses during class.

<h3>Ziaire Sherman</h3>
<blockquote>
"Yo."
</blockquote>
<p>
Head Bari Sax player of Squaritone Pianophone, Ziaire Sherman is literally too cool for this shit. Like, kind of a legend on the sax not gonna lie. Because he deemed being god on one instrument not enough, he also plays drum kit, clarinet, and steel drums. He`s responsible for the square wave-based genius featured in the “Phase Cancellation” EP. He chooses to live by a simple life motto and encourages the audience to communicate and not be stupid. Thanks.
</p>

<h3>Lilly Paul</h3>
<blockquote>
“It`s not moral support if you don`t have morals.”
</blockquote>
<p>
As the Secondary Bari Sax player and Local Cripple, Lilly Paul spends more time on the production end of things than the playing end. She enjoys pushing faders that change nothing about the sound to the untrained ear more than she does going “toot toot,” which, mad respect. “Zero Never Pi” is the song she`s most proud of that they`ve released.
